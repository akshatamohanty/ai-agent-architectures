# Designing AI Agents

This repository is a collection of projects, papers, design patterns, tools and examples useful for building AI agents.

## What are AI agents?

AI Agents are software programs capable of

- interacting with their environment,
- collecting data,
- planning,
- making decisions based on data,
- to perform predetermined goals,
- autonomously

## Types of Agents

- Simple reflex
- Model-based reflex
- Goal-based
- Utility-based
- Learning agents
