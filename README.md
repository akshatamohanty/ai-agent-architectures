### AI Agents
AI Agents are software programs capable of:
- Interacting with their environment
- Collecting data
- Planning
- Making decisions based on data
- Performing predetermined goals
- Autonomously

## Types of Agents
### Simple Reflex Agents
- Simple reflex agents respond directly to stimuli from the environment without considering the history of the world.

### Model-based Reflex Agents
- Model-based reflex agents use a model of the world to handle partially observable environments.

### Goal-based Agents
- Goal-based agents act to achieve specific goals.

### Utility-based Agents
- Utility-based agents aim to maximize their performance measure through a utility function.

### Learning Agents
- Learning agents have the ability to improve their performance over time based on experience.
